# Language chosen

**Technical Choice**
-  Language Chosen : Python – Flask

```Out of all the languages given in the GitHub repo, I was only familiar with Python and it required using Django, unfortunately I last used Django 1.5 year ago. So as suggested I went ahead with Flask framework. Since flask is a little easier to grasp as compared to Django, I learnt it from scratch in a day, in a matter of few hours to be able to reproduce this solution of the ‘Beverage MVP App’.```

# Trade offs

- Having the pages divided into an explicit MVC model while using Django would have been more complex to maneuver with but developing routes in flask is easier than Django from a beginner’s perspective, everything being wrapped in a main *app.py* file.

- I initially used a basic HTML form with JS to validate which consumed a lot of my time as I was unaware of a *WTForms library*  but discovering *WTForms* made the process easier as they are flexible in data validation and even provide the CSRF protection which was mandatory for this project.

- Due to the shortage of time, I used *Bootstrap 4* to provide basic layout and format to the web page. If I had more time, I could have built my own *style.css* file or beautified the webpage exhaustively using Bootstrap 4.

- Almost all the features are implemented except for the confirmatory URL which is working perfectly fine but displays the default supplied values and not the current ones. If I had more time, I would have brainstormed on how to do it correctly.

- If there were more time in hand, there would be a navbar with a cart button, the add to cart interface could be improved with a *‘+’ button* to directly add to the cart.

- A dummy database could have been established if I could spend more time on this project which would give an edge in storing all the successful orders placed which would make generating and displaying the confirmation number easy.

- The confirmation number for each order is hard coded currently, can be improved if given more time.

- Used docker for the first time to wrap this flask file into a container,image is built successfully but not being able to run hence sending a zip file too for the entire program
